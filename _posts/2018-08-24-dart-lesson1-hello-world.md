# Language Syntax
Before we are talking about the language,we can just see its syntax.It is very sample of you, if you are a developer,even a non developer could know it.so let us  talk about the syntax,every programming language  has its own syntax,as well as the Dart language. See below:

1. variable and operators
> this is very common and basic ,so you must know how to use
2. classes
> classes are beginning after object-oriented language ,such as c++,java. as the project language ,it must has the classes.
3. function
> when  develop language is created by scientists,it always support the function's calls.
4. expression and programming constructs
>  If we use some operations in a function,we also need some expression to concise our working.as well as the constructs
5. decision making and loop constructs
> the key words are `if` and `for` ,even through you know  a little about developing language,you may know these words.
6. comments
> It is very common function that is almost in every programming language.
7. librarys and packages
> If you want to use the codes of the other people or some functions that had been created by you before.you cloud use the libraries or packages to concise your code and manage your mind.
8. typedefs
> In every language,there are some many types,you can use them ,if it was not defined ,you need to define it by you self.
9. data structures
> data structures are very import,it can manage some complex data,you don't need to know much about algorithms.Just use it if you like it.

# Hello world!
> every one know that a developer begins with a "hello world" example,as this,I am not the exception.
```
 void main(){
  print("hello world")
 }
```
if you configure your dart environment right, you can run it within your .dart file,or just run in the online environment  [DartPard](https://dartpad.dartlang.org/)
it will print
```
hello world
```

# Command line
if you like command line ,you may want to use the command lines,but here,I do not want to take it ,for I just want to learn the language syntax at this time. So sorry about that.If you want to use it ,just run `dart -h` ,you can see the base command about it.

# Checked Mode
when you run a dart file in dart, there are two modes ,the one is production mode ,the other is the debug mode or test mode ,If you want to use the debug mode, just run file as this `dart -c xxx.dart`,at this mode ,if you have some error or warning ,the Dart VM will prints some detail messages in the terminal.
