# Support Data Types
There are five types in dart:
- numbers
- Strings
- Booleans
- Lists
- Maps
Before we talk about data types,we would see how to define the variable in dart.To define a variable ,there are many ways to do it.
  
```dart
String nickName ="Nie Bin" ;//define a variable named nickName and the type is String
var age = 18 ; // define a variable named age and the type is dynamic with int ,if you assign the age ="nie bin" ;,there will be an error.
dynamic address = "ShangHai";  // the variable name is address and have a dynamic type that you can assign any to it, if you assign address =1 ; there will not be an error.

```
